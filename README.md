# Arrays searching lab
Check if an array includes a string.
## Overview
Make a function called `findStringInArray(array, itemToFind)` that looks at all entries in an array and compares it to a string one by one. If the string is found then it prints a message that says the string has been found. 

Example
```js
let array = ["Pheobe", "Chandler", "Ross", "Monica", "Rachel"];
findStringInArray(array, "Chandler")
// Output in console => Found Chandler, its postion is 1
```

## Requirements
Go over the given array and do the following:
1. Go over all the items in the array and compare them to the passed string
2. If the passed has been found then print "Found _{item that was searched}_, its position is _{its index}_
3. If it didn't find it, it says item has not been found.
4. This should work with any strings array! 


Good luck :D
